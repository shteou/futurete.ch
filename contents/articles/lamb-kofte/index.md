My current recipe for lovely, spicy kofte.

<span class="more"></span>

* 1lb minced lamb
* 3 tsp. cumin
* 3 tsp. salt
* 3 tsp. black pepper
* 1.5 tsp. dried parsley
* Crushed red pepper to taste (Be careful!)
* 2 large cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 medium onion, diced finely
* 1 large egg
* Breadcrumbs

Whisk the egg and combine all ingredients, leave to sit in the fridge for an hour.  
Roll into small patties (~1.75 inches across) or sausages and shallow fry until thoroughly cooked, draining off excess fat as you go.

Accompany with:

* 1 Large red peppers, 1 large orange pepper, julienne
* A nice tomato sauce

Heat the tomato sauce and serve with the kofte and peppers! Perhaps add some other salad!
